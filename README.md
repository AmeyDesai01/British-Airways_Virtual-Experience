## Task 1 - Web scraping to gain company insights

Customers who book a flight with BA will experience many interaction points with the BA brand. Understanding a customer's feelings, needs, and feedback is crucial for any business, including BA.

This first task involves:- 

- Applying web scraping in unstructured data taken from https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/british-airways
- Analyze customer reviews using sentimental analysis to sort positive and negative reviews
- Preparing a PowerPoint representation to highlight our insights and analysis

## Task 2 - Predicting customer buying behavior

Customers are more empowered than ever because they have access to a wealth of information. This is one of the reasons the buying cycle is very different to what it used to be. Today, if you’re hoping that a customer purchases your flights or holidays as they come into the airport, you’ve already lost! Being reactive in this situation is not ideal; airlines must be proactive in order to acquire customers before they embark on their holiday.

This second task involves:-

- Building a high-quality predictive to predict successful bookings using customer bookings data.
- Creating a classification model to predict customer buying behavior
- Preparing a PowerPoint representation to highlight our insights and analysis
